# pixla

The Pixla project is an 8-bit music style soundtracker using intracker synthesized sounds.

## Build
Using Make:
```
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ make -C build
# make -C build install
```
Using Ninja:
```
$ cmake -S . -B build -GNinja
$ ninja -C build
# ninja -C build install
```

## Command column description

- `0xy` - Arpeggio, 4x speed playing note, note + x, note + y, note + 12
- `1xy` - Slide up, max 4 octaves up from note value then sliding stops
- `2xy` - Slide down, max 4 octaves down from note value then sliding stops
- `3xy` - Tone portamento, only xy == 00 supported (change pitch)
- `4xy` - Vibrato, x = speed, y = depth
- `7xy` - Tremolo, x = speed, y = depth
- `Bxx` - Jump to song position (0-255).
- `Cxx` - Channel volume 00-FF. Is reset to maximum value upon note trigger (but not on tone portamento)
- `Dxx` - Pattern break, set position to row xx in next song position
- `Exx` - Set global volume 00-FF. Will remain until a new value is set or song is restarted.
- `Fxx` - Set tempo, in 2 * BPM values (i.e. 0x40 = 64 = 128 BPM)

### Edit mode

- `Backspace` - Delete previous row
- `Insert` - Insert row at current position
- `Del` - Delete row at cursor
- `Return` - Clear note or command at cursor
- `Shift + Return` - Clear note and command at cursor
- `Ctrl + Z` - Undo changes in pattern (undo buffer resets when a new pattern is edited)
- `Ctrl + Y` - Redo changes in pattern (undo buffer resets when a new pattern is edited)

## Instruments/Patches
- Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release configurable per patch
- Up to three wave segments per patch
- Each wave segment has the following properties
  - A waveform (Lowpass Pulse, Lowpass Saw, Pulse with PWM, White Noise, Triangle, Ring Modulated Pulse)
  - A length in some time uint, or 0 to indicate this is the last segment
  - A starting duty cycle (for PWM)
  - Pulse width modulation speed
  - A note modifier keyword:
    - = 00 no change
    - < 00 subtract this from current note value, effectively adding the absolute value to the played note
    - \> 00 play the specified note regardless of the note in the tracker
  - A relative volume, values 0 = MAX/default, 1-127 = relative value
  - Filter
  - Ring modulation carrier frequency or 0 to use channel 0 frequency (when wave = Ring modulation)
